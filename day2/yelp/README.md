# Building Yelp Part 2!

Today, we will be using indexes to build on your work from yesterday to optimize performance and build out features for searching and filtering.

**Note:** Because this project will be continued from **Yelp Part 1**, we will be working in the same project files. There is no scaffolding for this Part!

## Recap 游대

**What is indexing?**

Indexing is a way of sorting documents on multiple fields. Creating an index on a field in database creates another field that holds the index value, and pointer to the record it relates to. This index structure is then sorted, allowing for faster searches, queries.
This uses the same principle as the hash table indices that pointed to an object.

**Why is it needed?**

Data is stored as blocks on disks. These blocks are read in their entirety. These blocks work like a linked list, where each block contains sections for data and a pointer to the next part in data. So, for example, block1 is at the end of the disk, and it points to block2 at the beginning of it.

So, to find something in a field, we require an average of N/2 block accesses to find the information, where N is the number of blocks. Thus the performance increase is substantial if we would have only one place to find information in. The indexes work like a book index. The system finds the index, that is **previously sorted** and then it points to the correct location on disk. 

In this case, finding a restaurant would be as simple as finding the restaurant in the index table, reading where it points to, and reading data from its location.

1. Unique Index on username.

* Hint: If you have users on your database that are duplicated, please delete them
before adding a unique index. Otherwise it will generate an error.

In Mongoose, we can create new indexes like the following:

```
var Restaurant = new Schema({
    name: {
    	type: String, 
    	unique: true
    }
})

// or

var Restaurant = new Schema({
    name: {
    	type: String, 
    	index: {
    		unique: true 
    	}
    }
})
```

Check out [**Mongoose documentation**](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html) (scroll down to _Indexes_) to see more about usage of indexes wiht Mongoose.


##Step 1: Paging Your Results 游늶
The first thing we'll do is page your Restaurant results to allow for displaying large quantites of Restaurants to be more manageable. This time, we'll start with our routes, since understanding how paging will work will begin with the URL.

### Rerouting Routes 游닋 - `routes/index.js`
Previously, you rendered the `restaurants.hbs` template with a single `GET` request to query for all of your Restaurant documents and pass them in. With paging, you will be rendering the same view, but changing the documents you pass in. You can accomplish this by making use of the query string! 

For example, given a database with 25 restaurants:

* `http://localhost:3000/restaurants/list/1` should render the first 10 `(0-9)`.
* `http://localhost:3000/restaurants/list/2` should render the next 10 `(10-19)`.
* `http://localhost:3000/restaurants/list/3` should render the remaining 5 `(20-24)`.

> 丘멆잺 **Warning**: Be careful about the names of your routes! If you already have routes set up for `GET /restaurants/:id`, you should access your list view by a separate URL - in this example we have it at `/restaurants/list/:x`.

Begin by setting up your routes to take in this new parameter (which is just a number) and for now, simply render your `restaurants` view the way you've always been doing and log your new parameter to keep it in the back of your mind. We'll use it soon!

**Note:** Keep your previous `GET /restaurants` route intact! You'll want to update it to only pass in the first 10 documents.

### Modifying Models 游눻 - `models/models.js (RestaurantSchema)`
We want to change the way we query for Restaurants to only give us back the set of 10 that we need. To do this, we'll create a **static** on our `Restaurant` model.

> **Tip:** The key difference between a **static** and a **method** in Mongoose is what they _are called on_. Instance _methods_ are called on a per-document basis; `this` for methods refers to one document. _Statics_ on the other hand are called on a per-model basis; `this` for statics refers to an entire model.

The reason that we want to use a _static_ here is because we essentially want to create a model `find` method that doesn't exist - something along the lines of `findTheNextTen` (which is not a thing in Mongoose, sorry!).

The way we define a static in Mongoose is identical to how we define a method, with the slight change:

```
RestaurantSchema.statics.yourStaticNameHere = function(anyParams) {
	/* your static definition here */
}
```

You want to define a static that takes in any integer `n` (received from your route parameters, it could be 1, 2, 99, etc.) and finds the next multiple of 10 restaurants to query for in your database.

Your static should also take a callback `cb` to call with an array of no more than 10 Restaurants after the query executes successfully. Your static will be called from routes like the following:

```
app.get("/restaurants/list/:x", function(req, res) {
	// Below, the static is called getTen, but the name is up to you!
	Restaurant.getTen(req.params.x, function(restaurants) {
		res.render(...);
	});
});
```

**Hint:** To retrieve the next multiple of 10 restaurants, you will be using [`.skip()`](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#query_Query-skip) (which "skips" a certain number of documents in the database as a part of the query) and [`.limit()`](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#query_Query-limit) (which sets a cap on the number of documents returned)! Chain these together and retrieve the result using `.exec()` to write this static. 

### A Return to Routes 游닌 - `routes/index.js`
To implement your model static functions in your routes, simply call it on the model (which in your case is probably called `Restaurant` or `models.Restaurant`) and pass in the callback function to handle the results of the query. 

Make sure to render your `restaurants` template with the correct data _within_ this callback function! Before moving on to **Reviewing Views** 游뚹, verify that you are able to access different reuslts in your database by paging as mentioned before:

For a database of 25 restaurants:

* `http://localhost:3000/restaurants/list/1` should render the first 10 `(0-9)`.
* `http://localhost:3000/restaurants/list/2` should render the next 10 `(10-19)`.
* `http://localhost:3000/restaurants/list/3` should render the remaining 5 `(20-24)`.

**Note:** You may find that you need to add more restaurants to your database before you are able to make this functional. Check your mLab to verify that there are more than 10 restaurants that you can page through!

### Reviewing Views 游뚹 - `views/restaurants.hbs`
Now that you are able to access any 10 restaurants using a part of the URL parameters to change where you are, it's time to update your view to reflect these changes!

You want a component that looks something like the following at the bottom of your page:

<img src="http://cl.ly/0a1R0V0b2w26/Image%202016-06-28%20at%208.12.41%20AM.png" height="50">

Each page number should act as a link to your route `GET /restaurants/list/PAGE_NUMBER` (or whatever you may have called it). One resource you can use to create the styling for this pagination component is on Bootstrap's handy documentation: [http://getbootstrap.com/components/#pagination](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#pagination).

Keep in mind that you only want to render a certain number of these paging links that reflects `the number of restaurants in your database / 10`!

**Suggestion:** You might use [`Restaurant.count`](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#model_Model.count) after retrieving the results from your static method to also pass in the total number of documents to your pagination component! Note that both `.count()` and your own static method both require callbacks as parameters.

### End Result, Step 1 游끤 - `http://localhost:3000`

After this step, you will be able to visit your Restaurant listings page and have the ability to 


##Step 2: Sorting Restaurants with Indexes 游늵

### More Model Modifications 游녦 - `models/models.js`

### Adding Indexes to Your Models 游돗 - `models/models.js`

### End Result, Step 2 游끤 - `http://localhost:3000`

1. Sort by price, alphabetical. Sort can be in Increasing or decreasing order.
- These are actual fields on db, properties of our restaurants.
-	Add a form of GET type on your Restaurants page. Add two drop-downs. one named "Sort By" and one named order for Ascending/Descending.
1. Sort by stars
- Mongo doesn't support joins, so the database engine doesn't know how many stars a restaurant has.
Stars are currently virtual, meaning they get calculated on Mongoose, not on mongo.
- Create a new field called "stars" on the restaurant's model. Additionaly, we need to recalculate these every time someone leaves a review for a restaurant, computing the average.
- Create a number of reviews field on the databaseToo. This will be calculated when a user leaves a review too.
- Sort out by using the stars field when the user selects sort by stars.


1. Sort by distance:
- Calculate current user's location. On latitude+longitude / Get it with maps API.
- Get the restaurant's latitude+longitude
- Calculate individual distances using the formula sqrt( square(latitude2-latitude2) + square(longitude-longitude2) )
- Sort.


##Phase 3 Search Functionality
1. New query: Case-folded name field for search. (write name to lower case field).
- Add a search form with a name field to your restaurants page.
-	Users can write queries in many different forms. For example "Cat" or "c치t" would yield different results. To fix this,
we have to case-fold texts, meaning making them as plain as possible, and as standard as possibe. Take a look at this link and try case-folding yourself! http://www.alistapart.com/articles/accent-folding-for-auto-complete/
1. Single field index (on folded name) that starts with name.
- Create a new field on users that contains the folded name that you are looking for.
- Create an index for that field, allowing you you query faster through folded names.
1. Write a prefix query on the thing that you are searching
- Create a query that finds users that start with the prefix, using the new index.
1. Composite indexes
- MongoDB supports compound indexes, where a single index references many fields in a document:
`db.collection.createIndex( { <field1>: <type>, <field2>: <type2>, ... } )` The value of the field in the index specification describes the kind of index for that field. For example, a value of 1 specifies an index that orders items in ascending order. A value of -1 specifies an index that orders items in descending order.
- An example of creating a compound index is `{ userid: 1, score: -1 }` it holds two fields in one index.
- The user is sort out ascending by userId, and descending by score.

- Lets say you have our restaurants:
```
{
	"_id": ObjectId(...),
	"name": "McDonalds",
	"location": "4th Street Store",
	"stars": 4
}
```
- To create an ascending index on item and stock you would:
` db.products.createIndex( { "name": 1, "stars": 1 } ) `
- The index supports queries on the item field as well as both item and stock fields:
`db.products.find( { item: "name", stars: { gt: 5 } } )`

* Show them explain plan as you go - make them take out index and re-insert index

##Bonus:
1. Use Yelp API or open street API to get JSON file of businesses
